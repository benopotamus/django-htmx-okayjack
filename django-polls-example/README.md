# Django Tutorial Polls App with HTMX and Okayjack

This example demonstrates using the following together:

1. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

2. [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)

3. Okayjack Django middleware

4. Okayjack HTMX extension.

I've taken the standard [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project's [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/) `polls` app and made minor changes to use HTMX and Okayjack. I also kept the function based views :-D
